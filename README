FormFieldAdditions
================

  Field prompts:

    This allows for input tags to have a :prompt option. The prompt string will appear grey'd out in the field if the field is blank. The field
    will clear on focus if it contains the prompt. It will also re-fill in the prompt if it blurs when it is empty. Select fields obviously won't
    change their values, but will toggle to grey and back.

    <%=text_field_tag :name, :prompt => "Type your name..." %>


  Tab Labels:

    These place a tab styled label above the focused window with the desired label. This works well with prompts, because you can skip the
    space filling labels that go in front of a form field, but you won't confuse users when they can't remember which field they are in.

    <%=text_field_tag "user[name]", :prompt => "Type your name...", :tab_label => "Name" %>
    
  MaxLength for textareas:
   
    As you know maxlength is not supported on text fields. This is an obvious oversite in html. This section of code as a :maxlength property
    to the text_area_tag helper. When the user reaches the maximum length, the text will start getting truncated.
    
    <%=text_area_tag "description", :maxlength => 200 %>

Installation
=======

1) You will have to link to the prompt.js file that will be added to you /public/javascripts folder.

2) Installing the plugin you will have to add some stuff to your stylesheets. These styles are defaults for this
plugin, but are easily modified. They also rely on two images that can be found in this plugins resource folder.
You should copy these two images into your images folder.
